                  Logic is the study of valid reasoning, argumentation, and deduction. Key areas of study include the
                  fundamental laws of logic (like identity and non-contradiction), meaning of symbols, structure of
                  arguments, and the relationship between logic and truth. Logic is a foundational element to
                  philosophy, mathematics as well as computer science.

                Propositional logic is considered to be the most basic form of logic. It serves as a foundational
                system that studies the logical relationships of propositions/statements, which are treated as units
                that are either true or false. It forms the basis of more complex logical systems like
                first-order-logic.

                Propositional logic deals with the truth values of propositions and how they combine using logical
                connectives. In the context of propositional logic, there are five main logical operators:

                <p class="m-0">
                    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both, while the least common
                    multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly. One way to find these is through
                    prime factorization, by comparing shared and unique factors. Another is the Euclidean Algorithm, which uses repeated
                    division to efficiently determine the GCD. These concepts are essential for simplifying fractions, solving equations,
                    and understanding number relationships.
