                    Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that focuses on the integers and integer-valued
                    functions. It investigates
                    fundamental concepts such as divisibility (what it means for one integer to divide another), prime
                    numbers and their
                    distribution, greatest common divisors, and factorization into primes. Beyond these “elementary”
                    concerns, number theory
                    branches into deeper realms: analytic number theory uses tools from calculus and complex analysis to
                    study patterns like
                    the density of primes, while algebraic number theory examines the arithmetic properties of numbers
                    in
                    more general
                    algebraic structures (like rings of algebraic integers). Many of its problems are easy to state but
                    famously hard to
                    solve (for example, the Goldbach conjecture or Fermat’s Last Theorem), and the field has
                    unexpectedly
                    rich applications
                    in modern cryptography and computer science.

                    Integers (ℤ) are the set of whole numbers, both positive and negative, including zero. Division with
                    integers often
                    leaves a remainder, which is captured by the equation a=bq+ra = bq + ra=bq+r where qqq is the
                    quotient
                    and rrr is the
                    remainder. The notation “a∣ba \mid ba∣b” means that aaa divides bbb evenly, with no remainder.
                    Properties of divisibility
                    help us test whether one number can evenly divide another, and these rules form the foundation for
                    later concepts like
                    prime factorization and modular arithmetic.

                    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both, while the
                    least common
                    multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly. One way to
                    find
                    these is through
                    prime factorization, by comparing shared and unique factors. Another is the Euclidean Algorithm,
                    which
                    uses repeated
                    division to efficiently determine the GCD. These concepts are essential for simplifying fractions,
                    solving equations,
                    and understanding number relationships.
