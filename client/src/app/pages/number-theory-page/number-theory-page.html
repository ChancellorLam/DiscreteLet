<h3>Number Theory Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
    Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that focuses on the integers and integer-valued functions. It investigates fundamental concepts such as divisibility (what it means for one integer to divide another), prime numbers and their distribution, greatest common divisors, and factorization into primes. 
    Beyond these “elementary” concerns, number theory branches into deeper realms: analytic number theory uses tools from calculus and complex analysis to study patterns like the density of primes, while algebraic number theory examines the arithmetic properties of numbers in more general algebraic structures (like rings of algebraic integers). Many of its problems are easy to state but famously hard to solve (for example, the Goldbach conjecture or Fermat’s Last Theorem), and the field has unexpectedly rich applications in modern cryptography and computer science.
