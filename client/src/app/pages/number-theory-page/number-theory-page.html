                    Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that focuses on the integers and integer-valued functions. It investigates 
                    fundamental concepts such as divisibility (what it means for one integer to divide another), prime numbers and their 
                    distribution, greatest common divisors, and factorization into primes. Beyond these “elementary” concerns, number theory 
                    branches into deeper realms: analytic number theory uses tools from calculus and complex analysis to study patterns like 
                    the density of primes, while algebraic number theory examines the arithmetic properties of numbers in more general 
                    algebraic structures (like rings of algebraic integers). Many of its problems are easy to state but famously hard to 
                    solve (for example, the Goldbach conjecture or Fermat’s Last Theorem), and the field has unexpectedly rich applications 
                    in modern cryptography and computer science.

                <p class="m-0">
                    Integers (ℤ) are the set of whole numbers, both positive and negative, including zero. Division with integers often 
                    leaves a remainder, which is captured by the equation a=bq+ra = bq + ra=bq+r where qqq is the quotient and rrr is the 
                    remainder. The notation “a∣ba \mid ba∣b” means that aaa divides bbb evenly, with no remainder. Properties of divisibility
                    help us test whether one number can evenly divide another, and these rules form the foundation for later concepts like 
                    prime factorization and modular arithmetic.

                    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both, while the least common 
                    multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly. One way to find these is through 
                    prime factorization, by comparing shared and unique factors. Another is the Euclidean Algorithm, which uses repeated 
                    division to efficiently determine the GCD. These concepts are essential for simplifying fractions, solving equations, 
                    and understanding number relationships.

                    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Numbers with more than 
                    two divisors are composite. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be 
                    uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, which makes primes the “building blocks” of integers. Although 
                    primes become less frequent as numbers grow larger, their distribution follows intriguing patterns that are central 
                    to number theory and applications like cryptography.

                    In modular arithmetic, we write a≡b (mod n)a \equiv b \ (\text(mod ) n)a≡b (mod n) to mean that aaa and bbb 
                    leave the same remainder when divided by nnn. This system is often described as “clock arithmetic,” since numbers 
                    wrap around after reaching the modulus. Modular arithmetic has its own rules for addition and multiplication, and 
                    introduces concepts like modular inverses, which allow certain equations to be solved in modular systems. It is a 
                    powerful tool used in problem-solving, cryptography, and computer science.

                    Several foundational theorems form the backbone of number theory. The Euclidean Algorithm provides a systematic 
                    way to find the GCD, reinforcing divisibility concepts. Fermat’s Little Theorem introduces a relationship between 
                    prime numbers and modular arithmetic, showing that ap−1≡1 (mod p)a^(p-1) \equiv 1 \ (\text(mod ) p)ap−1≡1 (mod p) 
                    for prime ppp. The Chinese Remainder Theorem explains how to solve systems of modular equations simultaneously, 
                    with visual or intuitive methods helping to make this abstract idea concrete. These theorems build intuition for 
                    more advanced mathematical applications.

                    Primes and modular arithmetic are essential for modern encryption systems, especially in securing digital 
                    communication. The RSA algorithm uses large prime numbers and modular exponentiation to create public and 
                    private keys, making it computationally easy to encrypt but extremely hard to break without special knowledge. 
                    Even without advanced math, students can see how modular arithmetic underpins secure data transfer and how number 
                    theory moves from abstract concepts to real-world technologies.
