                    In Discrete Mathematics, a relation is a way of describing how elements of one set are connected to elements of another 
                    set, formally defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. Relations are fundamental in representing 
                    associations such as “is equal to,” “is less than,” or “divides,” and they form the basis for many mathematical and 
                    computational concepts. By studying relations, we can analyze their properties (like reflexivity, symmetry, and 
                    transitivity), represent them using matrices or graphs, perform operations on them (such as union, intersection, 
                    and composition), and identify special forms like equivalence relations that partition a set into distinct classes.

                    Definition: A relation RRR from a set AAA to a set BBB is a subset of the Cartesian product A×BA \times BA×B.
                    That is,
                    R⊆A×BR \subseteq A \times BR⊆A×B
                    Each element of RRR is an ordered pair (a,b)(a, b)(a,b) where a∈Aa \in Aa∈A and b∈Bb \in Bb∈B.
                    If (a,b)∈R(a,b) \in R(a,b)∈R, we say “a is related to b” and write aRbaRbaRb.

                    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both, while the least common 
                    multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly. One way to find these is through 
                    prime factorization, by comparing shared and unique factors. Another is the Euclidean Algorithm, which uses repeated 
                    division to efficiently determine the GCD. These concepts are essential for simplifying fractions, solving equations, 
                    and understanding number relationships.
