      Our Lessons are the foundation of your learning journey. Each one is crafted to introduce the core concepts,
      definitions, and proof
      techniques of discrete mathematics in a clear and logical order. By following along with detailed explanations
      and step-by-step examples,
      you'll build the essential knowledge and theoretical understanding required to solve complex problems and master
      the subject.

    <h1 class="topic-header">Interactive Tools</h1>
    <p class="indent-content">
      Our Interactive Tools are where abstract concepts become concrete. These tools are designed to move you beyond
      static examples
      and allow you to actively experiment with the material. Whether you're visualizing a graph algorithm,
      dynamically building truth
      tables, or manipulating set diagrams, these hands-on activities provide immediate feedback. This process helps
      you build a deeper,
      more intuitive understanding and connects the formal theory from the lessons to a tangible, visual experience.

    <h1 class="topic-header">Quizzes</h1>
    <p class="indent-content">
      The Quizzes act as active learning checkpoints. They are designed to be low-pressure opportunities for you to
      practice what you've just
      learned in the lessons. By tackling these focused questions, you reinforce key ideas, test your comprehension,
      and get immediate feedback.
      This process helps you quickly identify any topics you need to review and solidifies your understanding through
      active recall.

    <h1 class="topic-header">Unit Tests</h1>
    <p class="indent-content">
      The Unit Tests are comprehensive checkpoints that bring together everything you've learned in a topic. They go 
      beyond the focused practice of quizzes by assessing your ability to synthesize concepts, apply techniques in new 
      situations, and solve more challenging problems. Completing these tests gives you a clear sense of your overall mastery 
      and highlights any areas that may need further review before moving on.
