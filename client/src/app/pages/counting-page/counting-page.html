                    Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that focuses on the integers and integer-valued functions. It investigates 
                    fundamental concepts such as divisibility (what it means for one integer to divide another), prime numbers and their 
                    distribution, greatest common divisors, and factorization into primes. Beyond these “elementary” concerns, number theory 
                    branches into deeper realms: analytic number theory uses tools from calculus and complex analysis to study patterns like 
                    the density of primes, while algebraic number theory examines the arithmetic properties of numbers in more general 
                    algebraic structures (like rings of algebraic integers). Many of its problems are easy to state but famously hard to 
                    solve (for example, the Goldbach conjecture or Fermat’s Last Theorem), and the field has unexpectedly rich applications 
                    in modern cryptography and computer science.

                    Integers (ℤ) are the set of whole numbers, both positive and negative, including zero. Division with integers often 
                    leaves a remainder, which is captured by the equation a=bq+ra = bq + ra=bq+r where qqq is the quotient and rrr is the 
                    remainder. The notation “a∣ba \mid ba∣b” means that aaa divides bbb evenly, with no remainder. Properties of divisibility
                    help us test whether one number can evenly divide another, and these rules form the foundation for later concepts like 
                    prime factorization and modular arithmetic.

                    The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both, while the least common 
                    multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly. One way to find these is through 
                    prime factorization, by comparing shared and unique factors. Another is the Euclidean Algorithm, which uses repeated 
                    division to efficiently determine the GCD. These concepts are essential for simplifying fractions, solving equations, 
                    and understanding number relationships.
