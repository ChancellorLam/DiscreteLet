                    Discrete Mathematics revolves around discrete structures that can be counted and separated (i.e numbers, letters, people). One of the important building blocks of basic structures is the set. A set is a collection of things. From sets, we can create things such as combinations, relations, graphs, and even machines. Another concept of basic structures is functions. Functions can either be represented as sequences (such as ordered lists of numbers) or Strings (sequences of symbols). Summations (a word for adding all the numbers together) are also utilized when studying algorithms. The size of sets can also be compared, even infinite sets can be counted and compared. However, other sets may not be countable, like sets of real numbers. This even suggests that there are problems that won't ever be solved by computers. Lastly, there will be matricies (tables of numbers) to help represent and solve problems with relations and graphs.

                    Sets are a simple yet fundamental concept in discrete mathematics. A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. 
            Sets are typically denoted using curly braces, for example, the set of natural numbers can be represented as &#123;1, 2, 3, ....&#125;. 
            The objects within a set are called elements or members. Sets can be finite or infinite, and they can contain any type of object, including numbers, letters, or even other sets.
            <br /><br />
            Heres an example of a numerical set:
            <br /><br />
            A = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#125;
            <br /><br />
            In this example, the set 'A' contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
            <br /><br />
            Try it yourself using the concept that sets can be numbers, letters, or words:
            </p>
            <input 
                type="text" 
                pInputText 
                [(ngModel)]="value1" 
                (input)="checkSetInput('value1')"
                placeholder="Enter a valid set:"
                />

                <div *ngIf="isValid1 === null" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Please enter a set.
                </div>
                <div *ngIf="isValid1 === true" style="color: rgb(110, 241, 110); margin-top: 10px;">
                    Valid set!
                </div>

                <div *ngIf="isValid1 === false && value1.trim() !== ''" style="color: rgb(230, 80, 80); margin-top: 10px;">
                    Invalid set!
                </div>

                <div *ngIf="isValid1 && parsedSet1.length > 0" style="margin-top: 10px; color: rgb(191, 50, 230);">
                    <strong>Your set:</strong> &#123; {{ parsedSet1.join(', ') }} &#125;
                </div>
                <br />
            <p>
                Now that you understand sets, let's move onto set cardinality (the size of sets).
                <br /><br />
                The cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements" in the set. For finite sets, the cardinality is simply the count of distinct elements within the set.
                <br /><br />
                For example, consider the set B = &#123;a, b, c, d&#125;. The cardinality of set B, denoted as |B|, is 4 because there are four distinct elements in the set.
                <br /><br />
                Enter any set to find its cardinality:
            </p>
            <input 
      type="text" 
      pInputText 
      [(ngModel)]="value2" 
      (input)="checkSetInput('value2')"
      placeholder="Enter a valid set:"
    />

    <div *ngIf="isValid2 === true" style="color: rgb(80, 217, 80); margin-top: 10px;">
      Valid set!
    </div>

    <div *ngIf="isValid2 === false && value2.trim() !== ''" style="color: rgb(230, 80, 80); margin-top: 10px;">
      Invalid set!
    </div>

    <div *ngIf="isValid2 && parsedSet2.length > 0" style="margin-top: 10px; color: rgb(50, 120, 230);">
      <strong>Your set:</strong> &#123; {{ parsedSet2.join(', ') }} &#125;
      <br />
      <strong>Cardinality:</strong> {{ parsedSet2.length }}
